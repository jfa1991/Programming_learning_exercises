# Python Practice Ex 33

''' For this exercise, we will keep track of when
    our friendâ€™s birthdays are,and be able to find
    that information based on their name.
    Create a dictionary (in your file) of names and birthdays.
    When you run your program it should ask the user to enter
    a name, and return the birthday of that person back to them'''

import datetime, random

a = datetime.datetime(2011,10,22)

# Creating Date Objects
# To create a date, we can use the datetime() class (constructor)
# The datetime() class requires : year, month, day.

a = datetime.datetime(2011,10,22)
print(a)

''' The datetime object has a method for formatting date objects
into readable strings.

The method is called strftime(), and takes one parameter,
format, to specify the format of the returned string'''

print(a.strftime('%x'))
